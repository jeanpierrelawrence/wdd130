            <img src="images/south-africa-flag.webp" alt="South African flag">
            <p>South Africa, at the southern tip of Africa, is a diverse, multi-ethnic nation known
                for its
                stunning biodiversity, rich mineral resources, and complex history, including the
                legacy of
                apartheid, transitioning to a constitutional democracy with three capitals
                (Pretoria, Cape Town,
                Bloemfontein) and 12 official languages, facing ongoing challenges like inequality
                and high crime
                alongside a developed economy. Nicknamed "A world in one country," it boasts varied
                landscapes from
                deserts to coastlines, supports unique wildlife, and is a major tourism destination,
                but grapples
                with economic disparities and social issues stemming from its past.</p>
