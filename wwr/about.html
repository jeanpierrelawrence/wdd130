                    Respect the water,
                    protect the wilderness, and ensure every guest leaves with a story worth
                    telling. We don't just
                    guide trips; we create life-changing outdoor experiences.</h2>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>It all started with a single descent down the 'Devil's Throat' rapids in the summer
                of 1988. Since
                then, White Water Rafting Co. has been at the forefront of white water exploration.
                We've
                spent the last
                three decades mapping new routes, training the industry's best guides, and
                perfecting the art of the
                river expedition. Today, we continue that legacy of excellence on every trip we
                lead.</p>
            <img src="images/rapids.jpg" alt="Beautiful scenery of the Devil's Throat rapids">
            <p>For years, the 'Devil's Throat' was considered impassable by local scouts due to its
                treacherous
                drop-offs and complex boulder gardens. It wasn't until our founders pioneered a
                technical line
                through the "left-gate" that the section became the crown jewel of the river. This
                breakthrough
                changed the landscape of regional tourism and set a new standard for whitewater
                expeditions in the
                area.</p>
